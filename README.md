# Language Models for Psychiatry

A comprehensive implementation and research project exploring the application of large language models in psychiatric healthcare, built upon Sebastian Raschka's "Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)" foundation.

## Project Overview

This repository focuses on adapting and implementing state-of-the-art language models specifically for psychiatric applications, including:

- **Clinical Text Analysis**: Processing and understanding psychiatric clinical notes and assessments
- **Mental Health Screening**: Automated screening tools for common mental health conditions
- **Therapeutic Conversation Models**: AI assistants for mental health support and intervention
- **Research Data Analysis**: Processing psychiatric research literature and clinical trial data

## Key Features

### Model Implementations
- **GPT-to-Llama Conversion**: Implementation of architectural improvements from GPT to Llama models ([gpt_to_llama_implementation.ipynb](gpt_to_llama_implementation.ipynb))
- **Psychiatric Fine-tuning**: Domain-specific fine-tuning for mental health applications
- **Ethical AI Safeguards**: Built-in safety measures for psychiatric use cases

### Specialized Components
- **Clinical Tokenization**: Custom tokenizers for psychiatric terminology and medical jargon
- **Privacy-Preserving Training**: Implementation of federated learning and differential privacy
- **Bias Mitigation**: Techniques to reduce bias in mental health assessments
- **Explainable AI**: Interpretability features for clinical decision support

## Architecture Highlights

This project implements modern architectural improvements including:
- **Grouped Query Attention (GQA)** for improved efficiency
- **RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding)** for better sequence understanding
- **SwiGLU activation functions** in feed-forward networks
- **RMSNorm** for stable training in psychiatric domains

## Ethical Considerations

### Privacy & Security
- HIPAA-compliant data handling procedures
- De-identification techniques for clinical text
- Secure model deployment strategies

### Clinical Validation
- Rigorous testing against clinical benchmarks
- Collaboration with mental health professionals
- Transparent reporting of model limitations

### Bias & Fairness
- Demographic bias assessment and mitigation
- Cultural sensitivity in mental health applications
- Ongoing monitoring for discriminatory outcomes

## Use Cases

### Clinical Applications
- **Symptom Assessment**: Automated analysis of patient-reported symptoms
- **Risk Stratification**: Early identification of patients at risk
- **Treatment Recommendations**: Evidence-based treatment suggestions
- **Progress Monitoring**: Tracking patient improvement over time

### Research Applications
- **Literature Review**: Automated synthesis of psychiatric research
- **Clinical Trial Analysis**: Processing and analyzing trial outcomes
- **Epidemiological Studies**: Large-scale population health analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- Clinical domain knowledge (recommended)
- Understanding of ethical AI principles

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anupsharma555/language-models-psychiatry.git
cd language-models-psychiatry
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Start
